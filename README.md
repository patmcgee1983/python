# python

This app is designed to work on a raspbry pi with a 320 x 240 touchscreen.

It displays a number of switches on the screen, which will control relay switches to solenoids to turn on a sprinkler.

Currently it displays the switches, and the switches can be turned on or off, or set to AUTO.

There is another button "...", which I want to open a new window to configure the timer for that zone.

Currently it is just the UI portion..

I'd love to see some forks on this!

Cheers.
